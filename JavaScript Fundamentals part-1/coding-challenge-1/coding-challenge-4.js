// Coding Challenge #4
// Steven wants to build a very simple tip calculator for whenever he goes eating in a 
// restaurant. In his country, it's usual to tip 15% if the bill value is between 50 and 
// 300. If the value is different, the tip is 20%.
// Your tasks:
// 1. Calculate the tip, depending on the bill value. Create a variable called 'tip' for 
// this. It's not allowed to use an if/else statement � (If it's easier for you, you can 
// start with an if/else statement, and then try to convert it to a ternary 
// operator!)
// 2. Print a string to the console containing the bill value, the tip, and the final value 
// (bill + tip). Example: “The bill was 275, the tip was 41.25, and the total value 
// 316.25”
// Test data:
// § Data 1: Test for bill values 275, 40 and 430
// Hints:
// § To calculate 20% of a value, simply multiply it by 20/100 = 0.2
// § Value X is between 50 and 300, if it's >= 50 && <= 300 �
// GOOD LUCK 

let bill = 430;
let tip = bill>=50 && bill <= 300 ? 0.15 : 0.20;
let tip1 = bill <= 50 ? 0 : tip
console.log(`Your total bill is ${bill}, the tip should be ${bill * tip1}, final sum ${bill + (bill * tip1)}`)
